"""
A base class for adding file diffing to your integration tests.

This base class deals with:

* creating the name of a temporary file to write to,
* doing a udiff between the temp file and a baseline file
* cleaning up the temp file if all went well
* outputting the diff, and preserving the tmp file, if error

    Inherit from this base class to add file diff'ing functionality
    to your integrations tests. To use this class, simply call

    initialize_integration_test(<test_number>)

    from each of your unittest test_<test_number>() methods, and then
    from the tearDown() method call:

    cleanup_integration_test()

    Then you can generate output files using the self.tmp_file
    filename and call the diff_tmp_file_against_baseline() method to
    perform a udiff on two files. If the files are equivalent then
    the tmp file will get removed by the cleanup method. Otherwise,
    the test will fail and you will receive the udiff output. The
    tmp file will be preserved in the case of a failure.
