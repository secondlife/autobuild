# Do not directly manipulate _updaters. Register each converter using this
# _register() function.
#
# 'fromver' and 'tover' are string literals of the form '1.1' or '1.3'.
# Do NOT pass the variable AUTOBUILD_CONFIG_VERSION as 'tover'! Register each
# converter with string literals. AUTOBUILD_CONFIG_VERSION will change later,
# but your conversion function's target version will not!
#
# Each conversion function accepts a dict in the syntax appropriate to its
# 'from' version key and returns an updated dict in 'to' version format, as if
# the original LLSD file had been written that way. Or it may raise
# UpdateError if the conversion is not possible.
#
# It is explicitly okay to modify the passed dict data: your converter need
# not copy it. (Of course, you may need to copy anyway if you're modifying the
# dict or a subdict while iterating through it.)
#
# Each converter should manipulate incoming file data as LLSD (using dict
# access) rather than using configfile classes because the configfile class
# definitions will CHANGE! That is, if you write your '1.1' to '1.2' converter
# using the 1.2 configfile classes, your code will be wrong when you import
# the 1.3 version of configfile. But as long as you code your converter
# strictly in terms of dict manipulation, it will continue to properly convert
# 1.1 configfile data to 1.2 format -- at which point we can pass it through a
# '1.2' to '1.3' converter with similar constraints. Finally we can load the
# '1.3' dict data into our 1.3 configfile classes. configfile data classes
# should only ever have to deal with version-appropriate dict data.
